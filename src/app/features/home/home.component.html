  <h1>Learn & Practice Blackjack Basic Strategy</h1>
  <p>
    This site helps you understand the rules of Blackjack and master mathematically optimal ("basic") strategy so you
    can minimize the casino's edge. Use the interactive chart and practice tools to build instinctive, fast recall.
  </p>

  <h2>Blackjack Rules (Standard 6/8-Deck, Dealer Stands on Soft 17)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Your goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>
    <li>Number cards = face value; Face cards (J, Q, K) = 10; Aces = 1 or 11.</li>
    <li>Each round you receive two cards; dealer gets one upcard (+ a facedown hole card dealt later depending on house
      rules).</li>
    <li>Player actions: <strong>Hit</strong> (take a card), <strong>Stand</strong> (end turn), <strong>Double</strong>
      (double bet, take one card, then stand), <strong>Split</strong> (if pair, separate into two hands),
      <strong>Surrender</strong> (forfeit half your bet early if offered).
    </li>
    <li>If you bust (exceed 21), you lose immediately—even if dealer later busts.</li>
    <li>Dealer draws until at least 17. A "soft" hand contains an Ace counted as 11 (e.g. A-6 = soft 17).</li>
    <li>Blackjack (Ace + 10-value on initial deal) usually pays 3:2.</li>
    <li>Basic strategy assumes no card counting—just optimal play vs. dealer upcard and your hand type.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Interpreting Hand Types</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hard:</strong> No Ace counted as 11 (e.g. 10-6 = hard 16).</li>
    <li><strong>Soft:</strong> At least one Ace counted as 11 (e.g. A-7 = soft 18).</li>
    <li><strong>Pair:</strong> Two cards of the same rank (e.g. 8-8).</li>
  </ul>
